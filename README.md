## Subprojects

Star Ring is made of a bunch of subprojects - each one of them is a specific package, but
they can be bundled together to form a better editor experience on Pulsar

## Generic LSP

A generic LSP client that connects to any LSP server (supported and, in the future, even
servers that are not officially supported can be used) and offers autocomplete, etc.
Status: Beta, usable. Needs Linter and Intentions for better experience.
